Weather-or-not

MVP
 - Build an interface that prompts a userâ€™s location and displays the current weather info about the location. Integrate whichever weather source you feel comfortable integrating and explain why you selected that source.
 
 - The app should require a user to sign in (does not need to be a full authentication process, just ask for a username to track the user), and the user should be able to setup multiple locations to check weather. When the app updates the weather info, it should update each location. The users and their locations should be stored in a database.

 - This task can be solved in whichever language you prefer. Please use whichever language you feel best showcases your skills.

 - Commit the code to GitHub, BitBucket, or other hosted Git repository and share it with our team to review.
